{:noCode: Simple HTML Editor :}
===============================

Allows you to edit the content of previously created templates or designs, it does not have options to change the design.

## DEMO

For the first example I have downloaded from https://templatemo.com/tm-568-digimedia the template, I have placed it on my server only adding at the end of index.html the code of the editor.

Once the editing is finished, I save the changes I receive in an index.html file to replace the downloaded one.

Same procedure for this example by downloading the template from https://startbootstrap.com/theme/grayscale
