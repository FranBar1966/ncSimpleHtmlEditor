## DEMO

For the first example I have downloaded from [here](https://templatemo.com/tm-568-digimedia) the template, I have placed it on my server only adding at the end of index.html the code of the editor.

Once the editing is finished, I save the changes I receive in an index.html file to replace the downloaded one.

Same procedure for this example by downloading the template from [here](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/grayscale)
